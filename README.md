# CSED703 Project

 * Deep learning for visual Recognition
 * Its title is temporally "Toward open set recognition with Deep learning" 

# Motivation

 * Let's solve open set recognition problem with deep learning technique.

# Strategy

 * First, solve problem with tiny data (cifar), then extend it to large data (like imagenet) 

# Progress
 * Proposed on October 12.
 * This page is made on October 21.

# Dataset

 * [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
 * [CIFAR-100](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

# Implement Enviroment

 * Ubuntu 16.04
 * Python 3.5 & Tensorflow with Anaconda 3
 * Atom
